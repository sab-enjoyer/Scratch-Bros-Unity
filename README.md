# Scratch-Bros-Unity

Super Scratch Bros Unity is an unfinished prototype of a Unity version of Super Scratch Bros, a Scratch game made by Hobson-TV.

It's main purpose is to bring GGPO online to an authentic port Scratch Bros, as well as some bonus features not possible in Scratch.

Right now I'm currently suffering from a stage 7 terminal migraine trying to figure out how to make rollback work.
