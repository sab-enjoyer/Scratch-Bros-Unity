# Scratch-Bros-Unity

Super Scratch Bros Unity is an unfinished prototype of a Unity version of Super Scratch Bros, a Scratch game made by Hobson-TV.

It's main purpose is to bring GGPO online to an authentic port Scratch Bros, as well as some bonus features not possible in Scratch.
In game, press "I" to switch character alts, F1 to save a state, and F2 to load a state

Right now I'm currently suffering from a stage 7 terminal migraine trying to figure out how to make rollback work.
